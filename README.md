# Development of Biodegradable Tableware from Rice Straw

This repository documents a published research project focused on the
development of biodegradable tableware using rice straw and plasticizers
such as sorbitol and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an eco-friendly alternative
to synthetic plastic tableware.

## Publication Details
- Journal: International Journal of Environment and Climate Change
- Year: 2023
- DOI: 10.9734/IJECC/2023/v13i92537
- Author: S. Pavana Deepthi

## Objective
To develop biodegradable tableware from rice straw and evaluate the effect
of different concentrations of sorbitol and PVA on mechanical, physical,
and biodegradability properties.

## Materials Used
- Rice straw
- Corn starch (2%)
- Sorbitol (20%, 30%, 40%)
- Polyvinyl Alcohol (2%, 5%, 10%)

## Methodology Overview
- Rice straw milling and alkali (NaOH) pretreatment
- Slurry preparation with starch and plasticizers
- Compression moulding at 180°C and 1800 kg/cm²
- Evaluation of physical and mechanical properties

## Parameters Analyzed
- Thickness
- Moisture content (AOAC method)
- Water absorption capacity
- Tensile strength (ASTM D882)
- Compressive strength (ASTM D6241)
- Biodegradability (soil burial test)

## Key Results
- Maximum tensile strength: 40.79 MPa at 30% sorbitol + 5% PVA
- Maximum compressive strength: 55.79 kgf at 30% sorbitol + 5% PVA
- Biodegradability: >70% weight loss during soil burial study
- Product remained fungus-free for one month

## Conclusion
Rice straw-based biodegradable tableware with optimized plasticizer
concentration provides a sustainable alternative to plastic tableware
while maintaining sufficient mechanical strength and biodegradability.
